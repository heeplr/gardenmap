# gardenmap

I needed a tool for hobby garden planning, to visualize a garden over the year.

This is a **very** simple webapp to do just that.
The backend uses flask (but could be easily adapted to anything as it's just very basic CRUD and data storage in json files).

DON'T RUN THIS ON THE PUBLIC INTERNET!


## Requirements

* python + flask


## Features

* uses SVG for pannable/zoomable garden map
* searchable plant palette
* add plants via drag/drop
* month slider updates visualized vegetation
* visualize plant height over year with gradient (blue = small, red = tall)
* move plant(s)
* box group selection
* keyboard shortcuts
* copy/paste
